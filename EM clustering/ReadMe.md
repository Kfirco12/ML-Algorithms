Here I implemented the Expectationâ€“maximization (EM) clustering algorithm for unsupervised classification of articles into clusters.

**Input:**
Here I uses the topic information for the evaluation (the header of each article contains a list of topic labels for this article).

Development set (develop.txt) and test set (test.txt) files are included in the data set provided. They are derived from a Reuters corpus, known as Reuters-21578 (since  
it contains 21,578 articles). They contain articles and their topics from a list of 9 topics (see  topics.txt for that list). 
I am assuming that the vocabulary size is 300,000.

**Output:**
An output file which describes and compares the elements of those smoothing methods.
