Here I implemented and compared Perceptron, SVM, and PA.
a training set of 3,286 examples  is provided and I classified between 3 classes.  
Those algorithms are implemented in the Multi class case and not as binary decision.

**Input:**
In the given data-set, there are eight features per instance (seven of which are numerical and one is the categorical) and three labels. Labels correspond to the Abalones age.
The data-set is split to train_x and train_y files.

**Output:**
Predicted results for each algorithm, using cross validation technique.
